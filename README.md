## ✨ Features

- **3D Pose Estimation**  
  Implements linear triangulation to reconstruct 3D joint positions from multi-view or calibrated camera setups.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**  
  Provides instant motion feedback on swing technique, posture, and trajectory deviations.  
- **Web Visualization**  
  Renders 3D skeleton and motion trails in a browser using Three.js.  
- **Performance Optimization**  
  Parallelized Python backend and GPU-accelerated CUDA modules for reducing computation time from 30s per frame to ~8s.  
- **Customizable Parameters**  
  Configure camera calibration, skeleton model, and feedback thresholds via JSON settings.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.8+, OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Pose Computation:** Custom linear triangulation module (CUDA-enabled)  
- **Visualization:** Three.js, HTML5, JavaScript  
- **Server:** Flask (or FastAPI) for streaming pose data  
- **GPU Acceleration:** CUDA Toolkit

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Node.js & npm**  
- **CUDA Toolkit** (for GPU support)  
- **Calibrated Cameras** or dataset with known intrinsics/extrinsics  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deterasd/AI_Coach_Detection-tennis.git
   cd AI_Coach_Detection
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**  
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure Settings**  
   - Copy `config_template.json` to `config.json` in both `backend` and `frontend` folders.  
   - Edit camera parameters, model paths, and feedback thresholds.

5. **Run the Application**  
   - Start backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     python server.py
     ```
   - Serve frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm run start
     ```
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
